# Fun370_QueryBuddy

A SQL query practice tool to help students learn and practice SQL in an interactive way.

## 🎯 The Story Behind This Project

We made it to the finals of the National Innovation Challenge, but we came up short. Then I realized exams were knocking at the door—and my CSE370 lab mate was also knocking at the door—so I thought, why not build something that lets me practice SQL queries in a fun way?

After working on it for a while, it turned out pretty good, and I figured it might help others too. So I polished it a little. About 90% of this is VIVE-coded, so obviously there are bugs here and there, but I hope it helps someone.

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimers

**This is not a suggestion or endorsement from any faculty of Brac University.** I'm not affiliated or commissioned to build software for the CSE370 course or for Brac University. This is just me, as a student, trying to help the Brac University student community—and anyone from other universities who has a MySQL course can use it too.

Since this project is largely AI-generated (VIVE-coded), there may be bugs and imperfections. Use it as a learning aid, but always verify your understanding with official course materials.
